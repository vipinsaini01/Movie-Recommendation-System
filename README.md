# Netflix Recommendation System

This project implements a Content-Based Recommendation System using the Netflix Titles dataset. It leverages TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity to identify and suggest similar shows and movies.

## Features:

* **Content-Based Recommendations**: Recommends similar titles based on various attributes such as title, director, cast, genre, and description.
* **Interactive Recommendations**: Allows users to input a title and receive 5 similar recommendations.
* **Genre Filtering**: Provides a basic popularity-based filter for different genres.
* **Interactive GUI**: Includes a mini graphical user interface (GUI) developed with `ipywidgets` for interactive use within Jupyter Notebook.

## Technologies Used:

* Python
* Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
* Scikit-learn (for TF-IDF Vectorizer and Cosine Similarity)
* IPyWidgets (for interactive elements in the Jupyter Notebook)

## Development Context:

This project was developed as part of a Machine Learning & Data Science learning journey.
